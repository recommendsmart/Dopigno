INTRODUCTION
------------

This module extends Field Group module and provides an
"Inline" group format, which renders child elements inline.

By default, child elements are styled to automatically wrap
to the next line. There is also **no wrap** option available.
When checked it will force all child elements in one line.
Gutters, Vertical alignments, and element widths are all
configurable.

It also comes with a render element which you can use to
programmatically create inline groups.
